scisim-addons
=============

This repository contains a number of OpenSimulator region modules developed
for the ScienceSim grid. In general, the modules are intended to enable 
the use of OpenSim as a platform for collaborative visualization though 
in some cases their usefulness extends far beyond the educational domain.

NOTE: code for the dispatcher and remote control projects has been moved
to https://github.com/cmickeyb/dispatcher
